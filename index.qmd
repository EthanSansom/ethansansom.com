I also work as a freelance data-analyst for the <a href="https://www.openresearchlab.org/about" class="black-link">Open Research Lab</a>, a San Fransisco based economics research group, and for Toronto’s own <a href="https://www.cleanairpartnership.org/about/" class="black-link">Clean Air Partnership</a>, a charitable environmental organization.
