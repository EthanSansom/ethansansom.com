Hi, I'm Ethan, originally from Saskatoon, <span class = "button-text">Saskatchewan</span>, now living in Toronto, Ontario. I moved here in 2017 to complete a Bachelors degree in Statistics and Economics at the University of Toronto. After finishing my undergraduate degree I worked as the University of Toronto economics department's longest serving research assistant, first working with Laura Derksen to measure the role of information access in social network formation in this [paper](https://drlauraderksen.github.io/mywebsite/DerksenSouza20240724.pdf) and then working with Eva Vivalt for nearly two years on an RCT studying the impacts of [unconditional cash transfers](https://evavivalt.com/wp-content/uploads/Vivalt-et-al.-ORUS-employment.pdf). I continue to work on the unconditional cash transfers project as a part-time Data Analyst for the Open Research Lab and have returned to the University of Toronto for a Masters in Statistics.

At work and in school I use the R programming language nearly every day for statistical analysis and <span class = "button-text">data</span> wrangling. I occasionally write R [packages](https://github.com/EthanSansom/vlightr) and frequently [plan to write](https://github.com/EthanSansom/typewriter) R packages. For tasks at which R does not excel, I am also comfortable using Javascript and Python. I am slowly working my way through [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) - I'll let you know here when I've finished.

When I have time, I like to meet and volunteer with cool data-people. From 2020-2022 I volunteered on the executive team of the Toronto Chapter of [Data for Good](https://dataforgood.ca/about-us/), where I helped organize events for students and data-oriented-professionals to meet and conduct pro-bono <span class = "button-text">data</span> analyses on the behalf of local charities. In 2023, I gave this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uoTKp7M3r8) at a Civic Tech Toronto event about <span class = "button-text">trees</span>, based on a [paper](https://github.com/EthanSansom/torontotreeinequities) that I wrote for an undergraduate course, also about trees (Civic Tech hosts hybrid in-person and digital presentations weekly, I'd recommend watching this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_kSEhsn1ik) given by best cartographer [Jeff Allen](https://jamaps.github.io/maps.html)).

When I have more time still, I enjoy reading old <span class = "button-text">sci-fi</span> novels - unfortunately I don't always know when to quit (I made it through the first 3 of 10 books in L. Ron Hubbard’s 1.2 million word Mission Earth series, which I can’t recommend). I also enjoy, but am less proficient at, trying to restore old <span class = "button-text">chairs</span> and other furniture. If you happened to shop on Queen Street West during the summer of 2018, you may own a wobbly live-edge wood table that I built. My preferred video game is Wii <span class = "button-text">Sports</span>.
