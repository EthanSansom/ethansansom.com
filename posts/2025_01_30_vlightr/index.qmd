For the past few years I have worked behind the scenes writing analysis
code for this [study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w32719) (and its
[friends](https://www.openresearchlab.org/studies/unconditional-cash-study/documentation)).
Over the course of the study, 3,000 participant's received dozens of
surveys, some annual, others monthly, and a few daily, which comprised
thousands of questions. Many weeks, it was my job to comb through this
survey data and bring my boss the most suspicious looking observations
(potential typos, data collection errors, contradicting responses, and
the like).

During our weekly zoom meetings, screen-sharing my tiny R-Studio
console, I frantically live coded to `filter()` and `select()` ever
smaller subsets of data while saying things like *"participant ID 5910295
responded `expense_toys_children` of \$90 in Survey 10, but in Survey 8
and Survey 12 said they had `n_children_in_household = 0`, so the
children expense questions should have been skipped"*. 

```{r survey-data, echo = FALSE}
# TODO:
# - add weird survey names
# - add NAs
# - insert the problem you talk about into the data
# - "my boss and I would spend some time quiniting at the following", praying
#   I had said the correct partipant ID
# - show how I wrote the original `highlight()` to solve this problem

# Names and values to sample for the `expense_*` questions
expense_questions <- paste0("expense_", c(
  "toys_children", "school_children", "food_children", "care_children",
  "food_out", "food_in", "books", "cars", "household", "recreation", "savings", 
  "insurance"
))
expense_values <- round(seq(0, 1000, length.out = 2000), 2)

survey_data <- 
  tibble(
    pid = c(rep(5910295, 10), rep(5910429, 10)),
    survey = rep(paste("Survey", 3:12), 2),
    n_children_in_household = 0
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    !!!rep_named(expense_questions, 0),
    across(all_of(expense_questions), ~sample(expense_values, 20))
  )
```


{vlightr} is an R package for highlighting arbitrary vectors in R. It
began as one function, `highlight()`, which I wrote at work
